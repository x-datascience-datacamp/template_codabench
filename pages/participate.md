# How to participate

Each section below is a short summary. The
[starting kit](TODO-link-to-the-starting-kit-notebook) gives the full argument,
with the data analysis behind each choice.

## The task

**TODO:** one paragraph: the data, what is predicted from what, and why it
matters.
In this template: a binary classification of tabular samples.

## The metric

**TODO:** the metric, whether higher or lower is better, and why it fits
the use case. In this template: **accuracy** (higher is better).

## The split

**TODO:** the unit held out (rows, patients, sites, time periods) and the
generalization it measures. If the test sets differ from the training set on
purpose (new sites, later dates), say so.

Your model is trained and scored with 5-fold cross-validation on the
training data, then each fold's model predicts the test sets. Every score is
averaged over the 5 folds.

- **CV column**: the cross-validation score.
- **Public column** (live feedback): a public test set.
- **Private / final ranking** (hidden): a private test set. Do not overfit
  the public column.

## What you submit

A single **`submission.py`** defining `class Solver(CompetSolver)`. All your
Python code must live in this one file: the platform loads it on its own, so
it cannot import other `.py` files you ship. You may add non-code files next
to it (model weights, configs) and read them from `meta["submission_dir"]`.

```python
from benchmark_utils.base_solver import CompetSolver


class Solver(CompetSolver):
    name = "submission"

    def get_model(self, meta):
        # build your (untrained) model
        ...

    def fit(self, model, X_train, y_train):
        # optional: train it (default: model.fit(X_train, y_train))
        ...
```

Your trained model must expose `predict(X) -> ndarray (n_samples,)`. The
platform **trains your code**, once per fold, then evaluates it. Copy
`benchmark/solvers/random-forest.py`, a working baseline, to
`my_submission/submission.py`.

## Run it locally, same code as the server

`local_config.yml` sets the dataset, the solvers, the seed and the 5 folds
of a local run. Add your `my_submission/submission.py` to its `solver` list,
then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
benchopt prepare benchmark --config local_config.yml   # builds the data
benchopt run benchmark --config local_config.yml
```

A command-line option overrides the file, e.g. `-s my_submission/submission.py`
runs your submission alone.

The cross-validation and public scores you get locally
(`objective_accuracy_cv` and `objective_accuracy_public`, averaged over the 5
repetitions) are the CV and public columns of the leaderboard. The benchmark
you run *is* the benchmark the server runs. Select your models on the CV
score rather than on the public one.
